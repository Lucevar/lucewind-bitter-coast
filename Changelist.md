# Seyda Neen - Damp Little Squat
* Started with Seyda Neen by hater8 as a base
* Added three new buildings - Coast Guard HQ, The Glass Parrot, and the Halfmast Hostel. Added some dock pieces and clutter to round out these locations.
* Added Rainforest of the Bitter Coast. Edited it for compatibility with this and Shipyards of Vvardenfell.
* Edited Nine-Holes at Arrilles to remove the Nine-Holes board (lol) for compatibility with Nine-Holes by Dillon, which is objectively superior
* Moved stuff around in Arrille's basement. Got rid of the kegs, put in a bed and some furniture - Arrille now has somewhere to stay! The room upstairs is just too bare to be his, clearly one of the people loitering around there is renting it (Elone or Tandram, probably).
* Removed dark lights from Lighthouse and C&E Office
* Added int to coast guard quarters; furnished the common dorm
* Added new coast guard NPC: Delves-Deep
* Replaced rugs in C&E office and warehouse with TD rugs
* Added jail cell to C&E warehouse (instead of the random keg room)
* Added room for Sellus Gravius to C&E warehouse
* Moved most of the C&E warehouse int into the C&E office int; now only the actual warehouse bit is called that
* Locked warehouse door, unlocked door of C&E office
* Renamed Adraria Vendacia's House to Processus Vitellius's House
* Replaced light outside Halfmast with a regular travel lantern
