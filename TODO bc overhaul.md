### Merge
* Make the NPCs generally "just landed in Vvardenfell" hopeful/despondent colonists
* Give Argonian OAAB bottles too.
* Rewrite quest dialogue - lore friendliness + writing style pass
* Double check reward balance (Rah-Jahr: bring him ten for health potion, afterwards he pays you three per crab meat?)
* Slave lady - Rewrite quest. Make her one of the working ladies? Something going on with one of the coast guard officers maybe, she's got attached but he has a wife back in Cyrodiil?
* Rewrite any dialogue referring to the message in the bottle if it relies on Addamasartus being close to town
* Nord with the tanto - have her ask for it back or something

## AST Arrille's Attic
